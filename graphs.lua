-- A graph G is a pair (V,A) with V being a finite nin-empty set and A a set of pairs that represent the edges of the graph.
    -- The elements of V are called vertices(or nodes).
    -- The elements of A are called edges.
    -- the number of vertices |V| is called order of G.
    -- The number of edges |A| is called size of G.
